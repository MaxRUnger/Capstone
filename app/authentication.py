"""Shared Supabase clients.

Two clients are exposed because Supabase enforces row-level security at the
PostgREST layer:

- ``supabase`` (anon key) is the only client allowed to call ``auth.*``
  endpoints (sign-in, sign-up, password reset). It runs under RLS like any
  end-user, so it can never be used for cross-row admin reads/writes.
- ``supabase_admin`` (service-role key) bypasses RLS and is used for every
  table read/write the server performs on behalf of the authenticated user.
  Authorization is enforced separately in ``app/routes.py`` (see helpers
  like ``_instructor_owns_class``).

Keeping these two clients distinct is what prevents the service-role key
from leaking into the auth path.
